# WEATHER FORECASTER WEB APPLICATION

This is a web application with a basic user interface that will check and display the weather forecasts for the next 5 days and automate the sending of emails out to staff.

**NB: This web application makes use of the OpenWeather API to get forecasts and uses GMAIL's SMTP Server to send emails.**
Link to the OpenWeather API: ```https://openweathermap.org/API```

In order to build this web application, I used code from previous projects and school assignments that I have done and tailored them to fulfil the requirements of this project.

Other resources that I made use of are as follow:
